Solve the following problems using R

## 1

What is two to the power of five?
```{r}
answer.1 <- 2^5
answer.1
```

## 2
Create a vector called stock.prices with the following data points: 23,27,23,21,34
```{r}
stock.prices <- c(23,27,23,21,34)
```


## 3
Assign names to the price data points relating to the day of the week, starting with Mon, Tue, Wed, etc...
```{r}
days <- c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri")
names(stock.prices) <- days
stock.prices
```

## 4
What was the average (mean) stock price for the week? (You may need to reference a built-in function)
```{r}
average.price <- mean(stock.prices)
average.price
```

## 5
Create a vector called over.23 consisting of logicals that correspond to the days where the stock price was more than $23
```{r}
#over.23 <- c(stock.prices > 23)
over.23 <- stock.prices>23
over.23
```


## 6
Use the over.23 vector to filter out the stock.prices vector and only return the day and prices where the price was over $23
```{r}
#over.23 <- stock.prices[c(stock.prices>23)]
stock.prices[over.23]
#over.23
```


## 7
Use a built-in function to find the day the price was the highest
```{r}
#highest <- max(over.23)
max.price <- stock.prices == max(stock.prices)
stock.prices[max.price]
#max.price
#highest
```
