```{r}
library(dplyr)
head(mtcars)
carsData <- mtcars
```

## Return rows of cars that have an mpg value greater than 20 and 6 cylinders.
```{r}
res <- carsData %>% filter(mpg>20,cyl==6)
res
#carsData
```

## Reorder the Data Frame by cyl first, then by descending wt.
```{r}
carsData <- carsData %>% arrange(cyl) %>% arrange (desc(wt))
carsData
```

## Select the columns mpg and hp
```{r}
carsData %>% select(mpg,hp)
```


## Select the distinct values of the gear column.
```{r}
carsData %>% distinct(gear)
```



Create a new column called "Performance" which is calculated by hp divided by wt.
```{r}
carsData %>% mutate(performance=hp/wt)
```

Find the mean mpg value using dplyr.
```{r}
carsData %>% summarise(mean(mpg))
```

Use pipe operators to get the mean hp value for cars with 6 cylinders.
```{r}
carsData %>% filter(cyl==6) %>% summarise(mean(hp))
```
