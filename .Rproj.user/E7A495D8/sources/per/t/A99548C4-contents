I'm not sure that lists would be very useful. They might be useful for storing data structures which are connected to each other, but which don't have the same data type. But I don't think there are many use cases where this is needed. 
 
## Create data structures
```{r}
vec <- c(1,2,3)

string <- "How are You?"

matrix <- matrix(1:25)

df <- mtcars
```

## Create a list, giving names to each element in the list
```{r}
myList <- list(my_vector=vec, my_string=string, my_matrix=matrix, my_df=df)
myList
```

## get specified elements from the list
```{r}
myList$my_string
```

## Explore the structure of the list
```{r}
str(myList)
```
