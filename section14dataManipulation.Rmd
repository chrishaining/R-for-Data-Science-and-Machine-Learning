# Data Manipulation


## dplyr
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
 head(flights)
```

```{r}
head(filter(flights, month==11,day==3,carrier=='AA'))

```

```{r}
#slice allows you to select rows - here we select the first 10 rows
slice(flights,1:10)
```

```{r}
# arrange by columns
head(arrange(flights,year,month,day,arr_time))
```

```{r}
head(select(flights,carrier))
```

```{r}
head(rename(flights,airline_carrier=carrier))
```

```{r}
# use distinct to select the unique values in a particular column
distinct(select(flights,carrier))
```

```{r}
head(mutate(flights, new_col=arr_delay-dep_delay))
```

```{r}
# transmute is like mutate, but only returns the new column you've created
head(transmute(flights, new_col=arr_delay-dep_delay))
```

```{r}
# use summarise to get a mean. na.rm=TRUE removes any NA values from the sample.
summarise(flights,avg_air_time=mean(air_time,na.rm=TRUE))

```

```{r}
# return a random sample of the dataset. The second argument specifies how many rows you want. 
sample_n(flights,10)
```

```{r}
# return a random sample of the dataset. The second argument states the percentage of total rows you want to return (so, 0.1 is 10 percent of all rows)
sample_frac(flights,0.1)
```

## using pipe operator %>%
```{r}
df <- flights

# whereas the order of a normal nesting of functions is outside to inside, the order of pipe operations is first to last. So, you start with a filter, then take a sample of the filter, then arrange the sample
result <- df %>% filter(dep_time>530) %>% sample_n(size=5) %>% arrange(desc(year))
result
```

## tidyr
data.table is a dataframe with a few extra features (mainly speed and simpler syntax). It's easy to get them muddled up, but probably not a problem.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(data.table)
```

```{r}
comp <- c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3)
yr <- c(1998,1999,2000,1998,1999,2000,1998,1999,2000)
q1 <- runif(9, min=0,max=100)
q2 <- runif(9, min=0,max=100)
q3 <- runif(9, min=0,max=100)
q4 <- runif(9, min=0,max=100)

df <- data.frame(comp=comp,yr=yr,Qtr1=q1,Qtr2=q2,Qtr3=q3,Qtr4=q4)
df
```

## the three Qtr columns might not be the best way to organise this data. Use `gather` to merge the columns.
```{r}
# gather, with arguments: dataframe, first new column, second new column, the original columns (can be done as a slice)
gatheredDf <- gather(df,quarter,revenue,Qtr1:Qtr4)
gatheredDf
```

## you can use `spread` to do the opposite of `gather`
```{r}
#gatheredDf %>% spread(quarter, Qtr1:Qtr4)
```


```{r}

```
